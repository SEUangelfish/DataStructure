# DataStructure
this warehouse contains some data structures implemented by C++ generic programming. 
some implementations utilize techniques such as multithreading optimization, cache pool optimization etc, which user can determine whether to enable through macro definition.
below are data structures which have been implemented and tested for availabilityï¼š
1. IntervalHeap  # also know as double-ended heap providing both maximum and minimum query online with the time complexity of O(logn)
