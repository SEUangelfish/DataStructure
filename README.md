# DataStructureLibrary
this warehouse contains some useful data structures unavailable in STL. All of them are implemented by C++ generic programming. 

below are data structures which have been implemented and tested for availability: 
1. IntervalHeap  # As an extension of the priority_queue, it can query both maximum and minimum in O(logn).
2. SplaySet # Its function is similar to set in stl. However, it is based on SplayTree which can perform better in special situations.
3. SplayMap # Its function is similar to map in stl.
